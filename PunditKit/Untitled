No, to be clear, you shouldn't just use the base spec if you are when Claude is implementing these things. It should use the latest verified version. So right now for cloud kit, that's the only one that's in there. And then eval kit v One point one is speculative, so is eval kit. We haven't verified that. Um physics kit is V one It's verify, but like should receive a very low score on the evals. It's not very good. And then Pundit Kit is doing pretty good. I like That one and v1.1 is the latest untested version, but it's yeah, basically, why we want to be testing Punkit. V1.1 and v1.5 is also speculative. I guess these should just be like documented somewhere. But Cloud Kit and Pundit Kit one well Hmm. I'm not sure to be honest. Can you help me can you help me make some decisions here?
