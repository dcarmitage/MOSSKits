## What's in a Kit?

```
KitName/
├── KitName.md   # The spec — this is the product
└── demo/        # Working reference implementation
```

The `.md` file contains everything: architecture, data models, API endpoints, UI specs. It's designed to be fed directly to Claude, Cursor, Copilot, or any AI coding assistant.

The `demo/` folder proves the spec works. Run it, deploy it, or use it as reference.
